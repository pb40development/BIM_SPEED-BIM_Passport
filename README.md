# BIM_SPEED-BIM_Passport
## BIM Passport
The BIM Passport is a comprehensive tool for managing and improving buildings. This open-source data repository contains the deliverable BIM Passport report, which includes evaluations of the building's maturity, compliance with BIM Modeling guidelines and standards, and compliance with relevant ontologies specifications. The evaluations were based on a set of criteria and scores were assigned for each criterion. The scores were then used to determine the overall maturity level, compliance level, and compliance with relevant ontologies specifications of the building passport.

The report includes graphical visualizations to provide a clear and easy-to-understand representation of the evaluation results. The visualizations include spider charts, box and whiskers diagrams, and line diagrams. These diagrams provide a clear representation of the scores for each criterion and allow stakeholders to easily compare the scores and identify areas where improvement is needed.

Based on the evaluation scores, certifications were issued for the building passport. These certifications provide assurance of the building passport's quality and compliance with relevant standards and regulations. The certifications include the overall score and scores for each criterion and are provided in digital form. They can be accessed online and verified by relevant authorities and stakeholders.

The report also includes recommendations for future improvements and an action plan for implementing these recommendations. By implementing the recommendations and taking the necessary actions, building owners, managers, and other stakeholders can improve the building's performance and compliance with relevant standards and regulations.

This repository is intended to be an open-source data repository, for possible users to download and use the BIM Passport.
